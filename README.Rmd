# r2d3wrappers

The goal of r2d3wrappers is to provide an easy interface to common D3 visuals.

## Installation

You can install this development package with

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("cwthom/r2d3wrappers")
```
## Features

Currently this package contains a wrapper for a calendar visual.

```{r example-calendar, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(r2d3wrappers)
library(dplyr)

# create some random data, sampling dates between 2019-01-01 and 2020-12-31
dates <- as.Date(0:730, origin = "2019-01-01", format = "%Y-%m-%d")

# aggregate so one row per date
data <- data.frame(date = sample(dates, 10000, replace = TRUE)) %>% count(date)

# draw calendar
d3_calendar(data = data, date = date, value = n, 
            start = 2019, end = 2021, 
            showToday = FALSE, dateFormat = "%Y-%m-%d",
            colors = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9, "BuPu"),
            height = "300px")
```
